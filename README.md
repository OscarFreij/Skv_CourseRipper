To use this tool you need to copy all the code to your clipbord and then paste it in the JS console on the following website:

After that you run a function called run by running "run()".
This will check for categories on the page and then send a request to the subpages.
When the data is returned it will create and download a "dump.json" containing all the data it collected.
